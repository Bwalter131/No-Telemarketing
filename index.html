    <p>Please Stop Calling me</p>
    <p>I understand that my contact information was sold to you when I purchased a domain. Unfortunately, I cannot change that, but you can help by not calling me.</p>
    <p>I only wanted a custom email domain and have no need for any additional services. I am maintaining this website specifically to request that telemarketers do not contact me.</p>
    <p>Please reach out to the source from whom you obtained my information and request a refund for the lead, as I am not interested.</p>
    <p>Thank you for respecting my privacy.</p>
